Hello, I am Daniela Grosclaude. 
I'm a frontend developer based in Buenos Aires ☀️. 
I describe myself as a passionate developer who loves coding, open source, and the web platform. 
I would like to create and contribute to open source projects. That would help me learn a lot of new things, grow as a developer, and support other open source projects. 
I also enjoy to learn new technologies, currently I'm learning data science and SQL language. 🤓
In my free time you can find me drawing illustrations that I share on my Instagram. ✍🏽
