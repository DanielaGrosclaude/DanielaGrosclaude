Hello, I am Daniela Grosclaude. 
I'm a student of frontend developer based in Buenos Aires ☀️. 
I am taking my first steps in web development. I would like to create and contribute to open source projects. I also enjoy to learn new technologies, currently I'm learning data science and SQL. 🤓
In my free time you can find me drawing illustrations that I share on my Instagram. ✍🏽
